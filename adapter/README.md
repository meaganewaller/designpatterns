# Adapter Pattern

> What do you do when an object does what you need it do, but its interface is
> wrong? Your interface mismatch might be very deep and complex, or it might be
> as simple as needing an object that can `write` but having an object that
> calls it `save`. The GoF would recommend an Adapter to you
